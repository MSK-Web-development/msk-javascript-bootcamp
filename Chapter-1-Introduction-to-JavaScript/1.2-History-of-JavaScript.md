| Year  | Event                                                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1995  | Brendan Eich creates JavaScript (originally called Mocha, then LiveScript) at Netscape. |
| 1996  | Renamed to JavaScript and included in Netscape Navigator 2.0.                           |
| 1997  | ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262) is published by ECMA International.                      |
| 1999  | ECMAScript 3 (ES3) becomes widely adopted.                                              |
| 2005  | AJAX popularizes dynamic web applications.                                              |
| 2009  | Node.js brings JavaScript to the server.                                                |
| 2015  | ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) introduces major new features.                                    |
| 2016+ | Annual ECMAScript updates (ES7, ES8, etc.) continue to evolve the language.             |

## Key Milestones

- **Creation:** Developed in just 10 days by Brendan Eich at Netscape.
- **Standardization:** To avoid browser wars, JavaScript was standardized as ECMAScript.
- **Browser Wars:** Microsoft introduced JScript for Internet Explorer, leading to compatibility issues.
- **Modern Era:** ES6 (2015) brought classes, modules, arrow functions, promises, and more.
- **Server-side Revolution:** Node.js enabled JavaScript to be used for backend development.

## Why the Name "JavaScript"?

- Originally called Mocha, then LiveScript.
- Renamed to JavaScript as a marketing strategy to capitalize on Java's popularity, though the two languages are unrelated.

## Evolution of JavaScript

- **Early Days:** Simple scripts for form validation and basic interactivity.
- **AJAX Era:** Enabled asynchronous web applications (e.g., Gmail, Google Maps).
- **Frameworks:** Rise of libraries and frameworks (jQuery, Angular, React, Vue).
- **Full Stack:** JavaScript now powers both client and server (MEAN/MERN stacks).

## Tips

- Always check for browser compatibility when using new features.
- Use transpilers (like Babel) to write modern JavaScript that works in older browsers.
