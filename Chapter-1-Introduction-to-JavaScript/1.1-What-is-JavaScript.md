# What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. Most websites use JavaScript for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

## Key Features

- **Interpreted Language:** Runs directly in the browser or on a server (Node.js) without prior compilation.
- **Dynamically Typed:** Variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Prototype-based Object Orientation:** Uses prototypes instead of classical inheritance.
- **First-class Functions:** Functions are treated as variables and can be passed as arguments.
- **Event-driven:** Especially in browsers, JavaScript responds to user actions and events.
- **Multi-paradigm:** Supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

## Where is JavaScript Used?

- **Web Browsers:** For dynamic content, form validation, animations, and more.
- **Server-side:** With Node.js, JavaScript can build scalable network applications.
- **Mobile Apps:** Frameworks like React Native allow building mobile apps.
- **Desktop Apps:** Electron enables desktop app development.
- **IoT Devices:** JavaScript can run on microcontrollers and IoT devices.

## Basic Syntax Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do                                              | Don't                           |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Use `let` and `const` for variable declarations | Use `var` unless necessary      |
| Write modular, reusable code                    | Write all code in a single file |
| Use strict mode (`'use strict';`)               | Rely on implicit globals        |
| Comment your code                               | Leave code unexplained          |

## When to Use JavaScript

- When you need to add interactivity to web pages
- For building web, server, or cross-platform applications

## When Not to Use JavaScript

- For CPU-intensive tasks (use languages like C/C++/Rust)
- Where security is paramount and code must not be exposed to the client

## Tips

- Always test your code in multiple browsers.
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features for cleaner, safer code.
- Learn about asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await).

JavaScript is a versatile language that continues to evolve. Mastering it opens doors to front-end, back-end, and even mobile and desktop development.
