# JavaScript Best Practices

Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable JavaScript is crucial for building robust applications. Follow these best practices to improve code quality, readability, and performance.

## 1. Use `let` and `const` Instead of `var`

- `let` and `const` provide block scope and prevent many bugs.
- Use `const` by default; use `let` only if you need to reassign.

```javascript
const MAX_USERS = 100;
let count = 0;
```

## 2. Prefer Strict Equality (`===` and `!==`)

- Avoid type coercion bugs by using strict equality.

```javascript
if (a === 10) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## 3. Write Modular, Reusable Code

- Break code into small functions and modules.
- Use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) for organization.

## 4. Use Descriptive Variable and Function Names

- Names should clearly describe their purpose.

```javascript
function calculateTotalPrice(items) {
  /* ... */
}
```

## 5. Avoid Global Variables

- Minimize use of globals to prevent naming conflicts and bugs.

## 6. Handle Errors Gracefully

- Use `try...catch` for error-prone code.
- Always handle promise rejections.

## 7. Use Linting Tools

- Tools like ESLint help enforce code style and catch errors early.

## 8. Comment Wisely

- Write comments for complex logic, not obvious code.
- Keep comments up to date.

## 9. Prefer Arrow Functions for Callbacks

- Arrow functions are concise and avoid `this` confusion.

## 10. Avoid Callback Hell

- Use Promises or `async/await` for asynchronous code.

## 11. Optimize Performance

- Minimize DOM manipulations.
- Use debouncing/throttling for frequent events.
- Avoid memory leaks by cleaning up event listeners.

## 12. Security Best Practices

- Never trust user input; always validate and sanitize.
- Avoid `eval()` and similar functions.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) in web apps.

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do                        | Don't                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Use `const` for constants | Use `var`                    |
| Use strict mode           | Ignore errors                |
| Write tests               | Ship untested code           |
| Use template literals     | Concatenate strings with `+` |
| Use modern ES features    | Use outdated patterns        |

## Example: Good vs. Bad

**Bad:**

```javascript
var x = 10;
function foo(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

## Tips

- Keep functions small and focused.
- Use array and object destructuring for cleaner code.
- Always test your code in different environments.
