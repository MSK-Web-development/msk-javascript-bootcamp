# How to Run JavaScript: In the Browser

Running JavaScript in the browser is the most common way to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. Browsers have built-in JavaScript engines (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox) that execute your code.

## 1. Inline JavaScript in HTML

You can write JavaScript directly inside an HTML file using the `<script>` tag.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="greeting"></h1>
    <script>
      document.getElementById("greeting").textContent =
        "Hello from JavaScript!";
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 2. External JavaScript Files

It's best practice to keep JavaScript in separate files for maintainability.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

```javascript
// script.js
document.body.style.background = "lightblue";
```

## 3. Browser Console

You can run JavaScript directly in the browser's developer console (press F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console).

```javascript
console.log("Hello from the console!");
```

## 4. Script Placement

- **In `<head>`:** May block page rendering. Use `defer` or `async` attributes.
- **At end of `<body>`:** Ensures HTML is loaded before script runs.

```html
<script src="main.js" defer></script>
```

## 5. Tips

- Use `defer` to load scripts after HTML parsing.
- Avoid inline scripts for security (Content Security Policy).
- Always test in multiple browsers.

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do                                  | Don't                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Use external JS files               | Mix HTML and JS excessively  |
| Use `defer` for scripts in `<head>` | Block rendering with scripts |
| Use the console for debugging       | Ignore browser errors        |

Running JavaScript in the browser is essential for web development. Master script placement and best practices for optimal performance and maintainability.
