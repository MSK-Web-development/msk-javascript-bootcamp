# Function Expressions in JavaScript

A function expression is another way to define a function in JavaScript. Unlike function declarations, function expressions can be anonymous and are not hoisted.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax

```js
const variableName = function ([parameters]) {
  // code to execute
};
```

- **variableName**: The variable that holds the function.
- **parameters**: Optional. Comma-separated list of variable names.

**Example:**

```js
const greet = function (name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};
greet("Bob"); // Output: Hello, Bob!
```

---

## 2. Named vs Anonymous Function Expressions

- **Anonymous:** No function name (most common).
- **Named:** Has a name, useful for recursion or debugging.

**Example (named):**

```js
const factorial = function fact(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return 1;
  return n * fact(n - 1);
};
console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
```

---

## 3. Differences from Function Declarations

- **Not hoisted:** Cannot be called before they are defined.
- **Can be used as arguments:** Useful for callbacks and higher-order functions.

**Example:**

```js
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Executed after 1 second");
}, 1000);
```

---

## 4. When to Use

- When you need a function as a value (e.g., assign to a variable, pass as argument).
- For callbacks, event handlers, or immediately invoked functions.

## 5. When Not to Use

- When you need hoisting (use function declarations instead).

---

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use function expressions for callbacks and closures.
- **Do** use `const` or `let` to avoid accidental reassignment.
- **Don't** use function expressions if you need to call the function before its definition.

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting the semicolon after the function expression (if using `const` or `let`).
- Trying to call the function before it is defined.

---

## Advanced: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

Function expressions can be executed immediately:

```js
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE runs immediately!");
})();
```

Function expressions are flexible and powerful, especially for functional programming patterns and callbacks. Practice using them in different scenarios!
