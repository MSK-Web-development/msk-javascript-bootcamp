# IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) in JavaScript

An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is a common pattern for creating a new scope and avoiding polluting the global namespace.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax

```js
(function () {
  // code here
})();
```

- The function is wrapped in parentheses to turn it into an expression.
- The trailing `()` invokes the function immediately.

**Example:**

```js
(function () {
  console.log("IIFE runs immediately!");
})();
```

---

## 2. IIFE with Parameters

You can pass arguments to an IIFE just like any function.

```js
(function (name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
})("Alice");
```

---

## 3. Why Use IIFEs?

- To create a private scope for variables (avoid polluting global scope).
- To execute code immediately.
- Useful in modules, event handlers, and initialization code.

---

## 4. IIFE Variations

- **Arrow function IIFE (ES6+):**
  ```js
  (() => {
    console.log("Arrow IIFE!");
  })();
  ```
- **Named IIFE:**
  ```js
  (function myIIFE() {
    // ...
  })();
  ```

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use IIFEs to avoid global variables in scripts.
- **Do** use them for one-time initialization code.
- **Don't** overuse IIFEs in modern code (modules are preferred).

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting the parentheses, resulting in a function declaration instead of an expression.
- Overusing IIFEs when modules or block scope (`let`, `const`) would suffice.

---

IIFEs are a classic JavaScript pattern for encapsulation and immediate execution. They are less common in modern code due to ES6 modules, but still useful in certain scenarios!
