# 2.4 Expressions and Statements in JavaScript

Understanding the difference between expressions and statements is fundamental to mastering JavaScript. This section covers definitions, syntax, examples, best practices, and tips for both.

## What is an Expression?

An **expression** is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Expressions can be as simple as a literal or as complex as a function call.

### Examples of Expressions

| Example    | Description           | Result         |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
| `5`        | Numeric literal       | `5`            |
| `'hello'`  | String literal        | `'hello'`      |
| `a + b`    | Arithmetic expression | Sum of `a`+`b` |
| `x > 10`   | Comparison expression | `true`/`false` |
| `myFunc()` | Function call         | Return value   |
| `arr[0]`   | Array access          | First element  |

### Types of Expressions

- **Arithmetic**: `2 * (3 + 4)`
- **String**: `'Hello, ' + name`
- **Logical**: `isActive && isAdmin`
- **Assignment**: `x = 5`
- **Function**: `function() {}`

### Expression Usage

Expressions can be used anywhere a value is expected:

```js
let result = 2 + 3 * 4;
console.log(result);
```

## What is a Statement?

A **statement** performs an action. Statements are instructions for the JavaScript engine to do something (declare a variable, make a decision, loop, etc.).

### Examples of Statements

| Example              | Description             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `let x = 5;`         | Variable declaration    |
| `if (x > 0) {...}`   | Conditional statement   |
| `for (let i=0; ...)` | Loop statement          |
| `return x;`          | Return statement        |
| `console.log(x);`    | Function call statement |

### Types of Statements

- **Declaration**: `let`, `const`, `var`
- **Conditional**: `if`, `else`, `switch`
- **Looping**: `for`, `while`, `do...while`
- **Jump**: `break`, `continue`, `return`
- **Block**: `{ ... }`

### Statement Usage

Statements are used to control the flow of a program:

```js
if (score > 50) {
  console.log("Passed!");
} else {
  console.log("Try again.");
}
```

## Expression vs. Statement: Key Differences

| Feature        | Expression               | Statement            |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Returns value? | Yes                      | No (performs action) |
| Used as value? | Yes                      | No                   |
| Ends with `;`? | Optional (if standalone) | Usually required     |
| Example        | `a + b`                  | `if (a > b) {...}`   |

## Expression Statements

Some statements are made by using an expression followed by a semicolon. These are called **expression statements**.

```js
x = 10;
myFunc();
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use expressions for calculations and value assignments.
- **Do**: Use statements to control program flow.
- **Don't**: Confuse expressions with statementsâ€”statements do not return values.
- **Do**: Remember that some statements can contain expressions (e.g., `if (x > 0) {...}`).

---

## Tips

- Every expression can be a statement if followed by a semicolon.
- Not every statement is an expression.
- Use statements to organize logic, and expressions to compute values.

---

## Notes

- JavaScript is an expression-oriented language; many constructs are both expressions and statements.
- Some languages allow expression-based control flow (e.g., ternary operator), but not all statements can be used as expressions.

---

## Summary

- **Expressions** produce values; **statements** perform actions.
- Understanding the distinction helps write clearer, more predictable code.
- Use expressions for values, statements for actions and control flow.
