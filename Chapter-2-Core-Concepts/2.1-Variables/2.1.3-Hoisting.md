# JavaScript Hoisting

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (script, function, or block). This affects variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) and function declarations.

---

## 1. What is Hoisting?

- **Definition:** JavaScript moves variable and function declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.
- **Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.**

---

## 2. Variable Hoisting

### `var` Hoisting

- Declarations are hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- Assignments stay in place.

```js
console.log(a); // undefined
var a = 5;
console.log(a); // 5
```

### `let` and `const` Hoisting

- Declarations are hoisted, but **not initialized**.
- Accessing before declaration causes a **ReferenceError** (Temporal Dead Zone - TDZ).

```js
console.log(b); // ReferenceError
let b = 10;

console.log(c); // ReferenceError
const c = 20;
```

## 3. Function Hoisting

### Function Declarations

- Entire function is hoisted.
- Can be called before they appear in code.

```js
foo(); // 'Hello'
function foo() {
  console.log("Hello");
}
```

### Function Expressions

- Only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment.

```js
bar(); // TypeError: bar is not a function
var bar = function () {
  console.log("Hi");
};
```

---

## 4. Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)

- The period between entering scope and variable declaration with `let`/`const`.
- Accessing the variable in TDZ throws ReferenceError.

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Always declare variables at the top of their scope.
- Use `let` and `const` to avoid accidental hoisting issues.
- Avoid relying on hoisting for code clarity.

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Assuming `let`/`const` behave like `var` with hoisting.
- Using variables before declaration.
- Confusing function declarations and expressions.

## Summary Table

| Declaration Type     | Hoisted?  | Initialized?    | Access Before Declaration |
| -------------------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| var                  | Yes       | Yes (undefined) | undefined                 |
| let                  | Yes       | No              | ReferenceError (TDZ)      |
| const                | Yes       | No              | ReferenceError (TDZ)      |
| function declaration | Yes       | Yes             | Callable                  |
| function expression  | Yes (var) | No              | TypeError/undefined       |

## Summary

- Hoisting moves declarations to the top, but not initializations.
- `var` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`.
- `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized (TDZ applies).
- Function declarations are fully hoisted; function expressions are not.
