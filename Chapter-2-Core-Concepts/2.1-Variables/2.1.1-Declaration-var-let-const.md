# Variable Declaration in JavaScript: `var`, `let`, and `const`

Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const`. Each has its own scope, hoisting behavior, and use cases.

---

## 1. `var`

- **Introduced:** ES1 (original JavaScript)
- **Scope:** Function-scoped
- **Hoisting:** Yes (initialized as `undefined`)
- **Re-declaration:** Allowed within the same scope

### Syntax

```js
var variableName = value;
```

### Example

```js
var x = 10;
var x = 20; // Allowed
console.log(x); // 20
```

### When to Use

- For legacy code or when function-scoping is required (rare in modern JS)

### Do’s and Don’ts

- ❌ Don’t use `var` in modern code unless necessary
- ✅ Prefer `let` or `const` for block-scoping

---

## 2. `let`

- **Introduced:** ES6 (2015)
- **Scope:** Block-scoped
- **Hoisting:** Yes (but not initialized, so accessing before declaration throws ReferenceError)
- **Re-declaration:** Not allowed in the same scope

### Syntax

```js
let variableName = value;
```

### Example

```js
let y = 5;
y = 15; // Allowed
// let y = 20; // Error: Identifier 'y' has already been declared
```

### When to Use

- When the variable’s value will change
- For block-scoped variables (inside loops, if statements, etc.)

### Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned
- ❌ Don’t redeclare with `let` in the same scope

---

## 3. `const`

- **Introduced:** ES6 (2015)
- **Scope:** Block-scoped
- **Hoisting:** Yes (but not initialized)
- **Re-declaration:** Not allowed in the same scope
- **Assignment:** Must be assigned at declaration; cannot be reassigned

### Syntax

```js
const variableName = value;
```

### Example

```js
const PI = 3.14159;
// PI = 3.15; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

#### For Objects and Arrays

- The reference cannot change, but properties/elements can be modified.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
// arr = [5, 6]; // Error

const obj = { name: "Alice" };
obj.name = "Bob"; // Allowed
// obj = {}; // Error
```

### When to Use

- For values that should not be reassigned
- For object and array references that should not change

### Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use `const` by default; use `let` only if reassignment is needed
- ❌ Don’t use `const` for variables that will be reassigned

## Comparison Table

| Feature        | var       | let       | const |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | ----- |
| Scope          | Function  | Block     | Block |
| Hoisting       | Yes       | Yes       | Yes   |
| TDZ\*          | No        | Yes       | Yes   |
| Re-declaration | Yes       | No        | No    |
| Re-assignment  | Yes       | Yes       | No    |
| Default Value  | undefined | undefined | N/A   |

\*TDZ: Temporal Dead Zone (accessing before declaration throws ReferenceError)

## Tips

- Use `const` by default for all variables. Use `let` only if you need to reassign.
- Avoid `var` in modern JavaScript.
- Always declare variables at the top of their scope.

---

## Common Mistakes

- Using `var` and running into unexpected scoping issues
- Forgetting that `const` only prevents reassignment, not mutation of objects/arrays
- Accessing `let` or `const` variables before declaration (TDZ)

---

## Summary

- `var` is function-scoped and should be avoided in modern code.
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped; prefer `const` unless reassignment is needed.
- Understanding scope and hoisting is crucial for bug-free code.
