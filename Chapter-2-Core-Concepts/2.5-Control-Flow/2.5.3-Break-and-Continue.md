# Break and Continue Statements in JavaScript

`break` and `continue` are control flow statements used inside loops and switch statements to alter the normal flow of execution.

---

## 1. `break` Statement

The `break` statement immediately exits the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement.

**Syntax:**

```js
break;
```

**Example (in a loop):**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i === 5) break;
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

**Example (in a switch):**

```js
let fruit = "apple";
switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("It is an apple.");
    break;
  case "banana":
    console.log("It is a banana.");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Unknown fruit.");
}
```

**When to use:**

- To exit a loop early when a condition is met.
- To prevent fall-through in switch cases.

---

## 2. `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.

**Syntax:**

```js
continue;
```

**Example:**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) continue;
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 3, 4
}
```

**When to use:**

- To skip specific iterations based on a condition.

## Comparison Table

| Statement | Effect                        | Typical Use Case         |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| break     | Exits loop/switch immediately | Early exit, switch cases |
| continue  | Skips to next loop iteration  | Skip certain iterations  |

---

## Advanced: Labeled Statements

You can use labels with `break` and `continue` to control nested loops.

**Example:**

```js
outer: for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    if (i === j) break outer;
    console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
  }
}
```

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `break` to exit loops when needed.
- **Do** use `continue` to skip unnecessary work in a loop.
- **Don't** overuse labels; they can make code hard to read.
- **Don't** use `break` or `continue` outside of loops or switch (causes errors).

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Using `break` or `continue` outside a loop or switch (syntax error).
- Accidentally skipping important code after `continue`.
- Overusing labels, making code confusing.

`break` and `continue` are powerful for controlling loop execution. Use them wisely to write clear and efficient code!
