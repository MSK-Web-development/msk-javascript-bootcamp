# Loops in JavaScript: for, while, do...while

Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, making repetitive tasks easier and more efficient.

---

## 1. `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used when the number of iterations is known.

**Syntax:**

```js
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to execute
}
```

**Example:**

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}
```

**Parameters:**

- **Initialization:** Runs once before the loop starts (e.g., `let i = 0`).
- **Condition:** Checked before each iteration. If true, loop continues.
- **Increment:** Runs after each iteration (e.g., `i++`).

**Tips:**

- Use when you know how many times to loop.
- You can use `break` to exit early or `continue` to skip to the next iteration.

## 2. `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

**Syntax:**

```js
while (condition) {
  // code to execute
}
```

**Example:**

```js
let n = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  console.log(n); // 0, 1, 2
  n++;
}
```

**Tips:**

- Make sure the condition will eventually become false, or you’ll create an infinite loop.

## 3. `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is similar to `while`, but always executes the block at least once.

**Syntax:**

```js
do {
  // code to execute
} while (condition);
```

**Example:**

```js
let result = "";
let i = 0;
do {
  result += i + " ";
  i++;
} while (i < 3);
console.log(result); // '0 1 2 '
```

## Comparison Table

| Loop Type  | When to Use                         | Condition Checked | Executes At Least Once |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| for        | Known number of iterations          | Before            | No                     |
| while      | Unknown number, pre-check condition | Before            | No                     |
| do...while | Unknown, must run at least once     | After             | Yes                    |

## Advanced Usage

- **Nested Loops:** Loops inside loops (be careful with performance).
- **Infinite Loops:** `while(true)` or `for(;;)` (must use `break` to exit).
- **Labels:** Rarely used, but can label loops for breaking out of nested loops.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `for` for counting or iterating arrays.
- **Do** use `while` for waiting on a condition.
- **Don't** forget to update your loop variable, or you’ll create infinite loops.
- **Don't** nest too many loops; refactor if possible.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- Infinite loops due to missing increment or wrong condition.
- Off-by-one errors (e.g., using `<` vs `<=`).
- Modifying the array or object you’re looping over can cause bugs.

## Examples

### Using `break` and `continue`:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) break; // exits loop at 3
  if (i === 1) continue; // skips 1
  console.log(i); // 0, 2
}
```

### Nested Loops:

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
  for (let j = 1; j <= 2; j++) {
    console.log(`i=${i}, j=${j}`);
  }
}
```

Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks. Practice with different types to understand their strengths and best use cases!
