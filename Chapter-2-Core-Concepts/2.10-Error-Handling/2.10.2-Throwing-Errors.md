# Throwing Errors in JavaScript

Throwing errors allows you to signal that something has gone wrong in your code. This is useful for input validation, enforcing constraints, or handling unexpected situations.

---

## 1. The `throw` Statement

- Use `throw` to create and signal an error.
- You can throw any value, but it's best practice to throw `Error` objects.

**Syntax:**

```js
throw expression;
```

**Example:**

```js
throw new Error("Something went wrong");
throw "A string error"; // Not recommended
```

---

## 2. Custom Error Types

- You can create custom error classes by extending `Error`.

```js
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ValidationError";
  }
}
throw new ValidationError("Invalid input");
```

---

## 3. When to Throw Errors

- Invalid function arguments
- Unexpected states
- Failed operations (e.g., network, parsing)

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** throw `Error` objects for consistency.
- **Do** provide meaningful error messages.
- **Don't** throw strings or numbers (harder to handle).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Throwing errors that are not caught (can crash the program).
- Not providing enough context in error messages.

---

Throwing errors is a key part of robust error handling. Use it to make your code safer and easier to debug!
