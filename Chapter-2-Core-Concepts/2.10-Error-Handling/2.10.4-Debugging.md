# Debugging in JavaScript

Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in your code. JavaScript provides several tools and techniques for effective debugging.

---

## 1. Console Methods

- `console.log()`: Print values for inspection
- `console.error()`: Print error messages
- `console.warn()`: Print warnings
- `console.table()`: Display tabular data

---

## 2. Using Breakpoints

- Use browser DevTools or IDEs to set breakpoints and step through code.
- Inspect variables, call stack, and execution flow interactively.

---

## 3. Stack Traces

- Error objects provide a stack trace to help locate the source of errors.
- Use `console.trace()` to print the current stack trace.

---

## 4. Debugger Statement

- Use `debugger;` in your code to pause execution when DevTools are open.

```js
debugger;
```

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `console.log` for quick checks.
- **Do** use breakpoints for complex issues.
- **Don't** leave debugging code (like `debugger;`) in production.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Relying only on `console.log` for complex bugs.
- Ignoring stack traces or error messages.

Effective debugging saves time and helps you understand your code better. Use the right tools for the job!
