# Object Properties in JavaScript

Properties are the named values (key-value pairs) stored in objects. Understanding how to define, access, and manage properties is essential.

---

## 1. Defining Properties

- **When creating:**
  ```js
  const car = { brand: "Toyota", year: 2020 };
  ```
- **After creation:**
  ```js
  car.color = "red";
  car["model"] = "Corolla";
  ```

---

## 2. Property Names

- Can be strings or symbols.
- If using special characters or spaces, use quotes: `{ 'first name': 'Alice' }`.

---

## 3. Property Values

- Can be any data type: string, number, array, object, function, etc.

---

## 4. Checking for Properties

- Use `in` operator: `'brand' in car // true`
- Use `hasOwnProperty`: `car.hasOwnProperty('year') // true`

---

## 5. Deleting Properties

- Use `delete` operator: `delete car.year;`

---

## 6. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use dot notation for valid identifiers.
- **Do** use bracket notation for dynamic or special property names.
- **Don't** use `delete` unless necessary (can affect performance).

---

## 7. Common Pitfalls

- Using dot notation for property names with spaces or special characters.
- Accidentally overwriting properties.

Properties are the core of objects. Mastering them is key to effective JavaScript programming!
