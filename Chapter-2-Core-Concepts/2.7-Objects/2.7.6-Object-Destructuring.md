# Object Destructuring in JavaScript (ES6+)

Destructuring allows you to extract properties from objects into variables in a concise way.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax

```js
const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
const { name, age } = person;
console.log(name); // Alice
console.log(age); // 25
```

---

## 2. Renaming Variables

You can assign properties to variables with different names.

```js
const { name: userName } = person;
console.log(userName); // Alice
```

---

## 3. Default Values

Provide defaults for missing properties.

```js
const { city = "Unknown" } = person;
console.log(city); // Unknown
```

---

## 4. Nested Destructuring

```js
const user = { profile: { email: "a@b.com" } };
const {
  profile: { email },
} = user;
console.log(email); // a@b.com
```

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use destructuring for cleaner, more readable code.
- **Do** provide default values for optional properties.
- **Don't** destructure deeply nested objects unless necessary.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Trying to destructure `undefined` or `null` (causes errors).
- Overusing destructuring, making code less clear.

Destructuring is a powerful feature for extracting data from objects. Use it to write concise and readable code!
