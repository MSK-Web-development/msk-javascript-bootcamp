# Accessing Object Properties in JavaScript

You can access object properties using dot notation or bracket notation.

---

## 1. Dot Notation

- Use when property names are valid identifiers (no spaces, special characters, or starting with a number).

**Syntax:**

```js
object.property;
```

**Example:**

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(user.name); // Alice
```

---

## 2. Bracket Notation

- Use when property names are dynamic, have spaces, or special characters.

**Syntax:**

```js
object["property"];
```

**Example:**

```js
const user = { "first name": "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(user["first name"]); // Alice
```

---

## 3. Dynamic Property Access

- Bracket notation allows using variables as property names.

```js
const key = "age";
console.log(user[key]); // 25
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use dot notation for simple, static property names.
- **Do** use bracket notation for dynamic or special property names.
- **Don't** use dot notation for property names with spaces or special characters.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Mixing up dot and bracket notation.
- Using undefined variables as property names in bracket notation.

Accessing properties correctly is fundamental for working with objects in JavaScript!
