# Object Methods in JavaScript

Object methods are functions stored as properties on objects. They allow objects to perform actions.

---

## 1. Defining Methods

- **Inside object literal:**
  ```js
  const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: function () {
      console.log("Hello!");
    },
  };
  person.greet(); // Hello!
  ```
- **ES6 shorthand:**
  ```js
  const person = {
    greet() {
      console.log("Hi!");
    },
  };
  person.greet(); // Hi!
  ```

---

## 2. Using `this` Keyword

- `this` refers to the object the method is called on.
  ```js
  const car = {
    brand: "Toyota",
    showBrand() {
      console.log(this.brand);
    },
  };
  car.showBrand(); // Toyota
  ```

---

## 3. Adding Methods After Creation

```js
const user = {};
user.sayHi = function () {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
user.sayHi();
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use methods to add behavior to objects.
- **Do** use `this` to access other properties in the same object.
- **Don't** use arrow functions for methods if you need `this` to refer to the object.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Using arrow functions as methods (they don't have their own `this`).
- Forgetting to use `this` when accessing other properties.

---

Methods make objects active and powerful. Use them to encapsulate behavior with data!
