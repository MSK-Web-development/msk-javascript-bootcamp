# Creating Objects in JavaScript

Objects are collections of key-value pairs used to store and organize data. They are fundamental to JavaScript and can represent real-world entities.

---

## 1. Object Literals

The most common way to create objects is using curly braces `{}`.

**Syntax:**

```js
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};
```

---

## 2. Using the `new Object()` Constructor

```js
const obj = new Object();
obj.key = "value";
```

---

## 3. Using Functions as Constructors

Functions can be used to create multiple similar objects.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}
const bob = new Person("Bob", 30);
```

---

## 4. Using `Object.create()`

Creates a new object with the specified prototype.

```js
const proto = {
  greet() {
    console.log("Hi!");
  },
};
const obj = Object.create(proto);
obj.greet(); // Hi!
```

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use object literals for simple objects.
- **Do** use constructor functions or classes for multiple similar objects.
- **Don't** use `new Object()` unless necessary.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting `new` with constructor functions (creates global variables).
- Overwriting objects instead of modifying properties.

---

Objects are the backbone of JavaScript. Practice creating them in different ways to understand their flexibility!
