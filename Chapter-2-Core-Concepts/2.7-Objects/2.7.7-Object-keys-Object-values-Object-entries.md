# Object.keys, Object.values, and Object.entries in JavaScript

These static methods allow you to work with the properties of objects as arrays.

---

## 1. `Object.keys()`

- Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property names.

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
console.log(Object.keys(user)); // ['name', 'age']
```

---

## 2. `Object.values()`

- Returns an array of the object's own enumerable property values.

```js
console.log(Object.values(user)); // ['Alice', 25]
```

---

## 3. `Object.entries()`

- Returns an array of the object's own enumerable [key, value] pairs.

```js
console.log(Object.entries(user)); // [['name', 'Alice'], ['age', 25]]
```

---

## 4. Use Cases

- Iterating over properties:
  ```js
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(user)) {
    console.log(key, value);
  }
  ```
- Converting objects to arrays for mapping, filtering, etc.

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use these methods for working with object properties as arrays.
- **Don't** expect them to include inherited or non-enumerable properties.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting that order is not guaranteed (though most engines preserve insertion order).
- Using on non-objects (will throw an error).

---

These methods are essential for modern JavaScript, making it easy to manipulate and iterate over object data!
