# Nested Objects in JavaScript

Objects can contain other objects as property values. These are called nested objects.

---

## 1. Defining Nested Objects

```js
const user = {
  name: "Alice",
  address: {
    city: "Wonderland",
    zip: "12345",
  },
};
```

---

## 2. Accessing Nested Properties

Use dot or bracket notation repeatedly.

```js
console.log(user.address.city); // Wonderland
console.log(user["address"]["zip"]); // 12345
```

---

## 3. Modifying Nested Properties

```js
user.address.city = "New City";
```

---

## 4. Checking for Nested Properties

- Use optional chaining (ES2020+): `user.address?.city`
- Use checks: `if (user.address && user.address.city)`

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use nested objects to organize related data.
- **Do** use optional chaining to avoid errors.
- **Don't** nest too deeply (can make code hard to read).

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Accessing properties of `undefined` (use optional chaining or checks).
- Over-nesting, making data hard to manage.

---

Nested objects help structure complex data. Use them wisely for clarity and maintainability!
