# Array Iteration in JavaScript

Iterating over arrays is a common task. JavaScript provides several ways to loop through array elements.

---

## 1. Classic for Loop

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}
```

---

## 2. for...of Loop (ES6+)

```js
for (const value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}
```

---

## 3. forEach Method

```js
arr.forEach(function (item, index) {
  console.log(item, index);
});
```

---

## 4. map, filter, reduce

- `map`: Transform each element, returns new array.
- `filter`: Keep elements that pass a test.
- `reduce`: Accumulate a single value.

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `for...of` or `forEach` for readability.
- **Do** use `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for transformations.
- **Don't** modify the array while iterating (can cause bugs).

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Off-by-one errors in classic for loops.
- Using `break` or `continue` in `forEach` (does not work).

Choose the right iteration method for your use case to write clean and efficient code!
