# Creating Arrays in JavaScript

Arrays are ordered collections of values. They are used to store lists of items and are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript.

---

## 1. Array Literals

The most common way to create arrays is using square brackets `[]`.

**Syntax:**

```js
const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
```

- Arrays can contain any data type: numbers, strings, objects, even other arrays.

---

## 2. Using the Array Constructor

```js
const arr = new Array(3); // [empty Ã— 3]
const arr2 = new Array("a", "b", "c"); // ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

- Not recommended for most cases due to confusion with single numeric argument.

---

## 3. Array.of and Array.from (ES6+)

- `Array.of(...items)`: Creates an array from arguments.
  ```js
  const arr = Array.of(1, 2, 3); // [1, 2, 3]
  ```
- `Array.from(arrayLike, mapFn?)`: Creates an array from array-like or iterable objects.
  ```js
  const str = "hello";
  const chars = Array.from(str); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
  ```

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use array literals for most cases.
- **Do** use `Array.from` for converting array-like objects.
- **Don't** use `new Array(number)` unless you know what you're doing.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Using `new Array(5)` creates an array with 5 empty slots, not `[5]`.
- Arrays are zero-indexed: first element is at index 0.

Arrays are fundamental for storing and manipulating lists of data. Practice creating them in different ways!
