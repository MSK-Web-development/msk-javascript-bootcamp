# JavaScript Ternary Operator (`? :`)

The ternary operator is a concise way to perform conditional logic. It is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands.

---

## 1. Syntax

```js
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse;
```

- **condition:** An expression that evaluates to true or false
- **exprIfTrue:** Expression executed if condition is true
- **exprIfFalse:** Expression executed if condition is false

---

## 2. Usage and Examples

### Basic Example

```js
let age = 18;
let canVote = age >= 18 ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // 'Yes'
```

### Nested Ternary

```js
let score = 85;
let grade = score > 90 ? "A" : score > 80 ? "B" : "C";
console.log(grade); // 'B'
```

### As a Return Value

```js
function getFee(isMember) {
  return isMember ? "$2.00" : "$10.00";
}
```

## 3. When to Use

- For simple, concise conditional assignments
- In return statements for short logic

---

## 4. Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use for simple, clear conditions
- ❌ Don’t nest ternaries for complex logic (use `if-else` instead)
- ✅ Use parentheses for clarity in complex expressions

---

## 5. Common Mistakes

- Overusing or nesting ternaries, making code hard to read
- Forgetting that both branches must be valid expressions

---

## 6. Ternary vs. if-else

- Ternary is an expression, not a statement
- Use `if-else` for multiple or complex branches

---

## 7. Summary Table

| Syntax      | Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `a ? b : c` | If a is true, return b, else c |

---

## Summary

- The ternary operator is a concise alternative to `if-else`
- Use for simple, readable conditions
- Avoid over-nesting for maintainability
