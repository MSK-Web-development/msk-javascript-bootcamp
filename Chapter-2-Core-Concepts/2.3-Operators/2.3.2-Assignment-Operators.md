# JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. JavaScript provides several assignment operators for different operations.

---

## 1. Basic Assignment Operator

| Operator | Name       | Example | Result     |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| `=`      | Assignment | `x = 5` | `x` is `5` |

### Example

```js
let x = 10;
```

---

## 2. Compound Assignment Operators

| Operator | Name                | Example   | Equivalent To |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `+=`     | Add and assign      | `x += 2`  | `x = x + 2`   |
| `-=`     | Subtract and assign | `x -= 2`  | `x = x - 2`   |
| `*=`     | Multiply and assign | `x *= 2`  | `x = x * 2`   |
| `/=`     | Divide and assign   | `x /= 2`  | `x = x / 2`   |
| `%=`     | Modulus and assign  | `x %= 2`  | `x = x % 2`   |
| `**=`    | Exponent and assign | `x **= 2` | `x = x ** 2`  |

### Examples

```js
let y = 5;
y += 3; // 8
y -= 2; // 6
y *= 2; // 12
y /= 3; // 4
y %= 3; // 1
y **= 2; // 1
```

## 3. Bitwise Assignment Operators

| Operator | Name                            | Example       | Equivalent To |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---- | ------ | --- |
| `&=`     | AND and assign                  | `x &= 2`      | `x = x & 2`   |
| `        | =`                              | OR and assign | `x            | = 2` | `x = x | 2`  |
| `^=`     | XOR and assign                  | `x ^= 2`      | `x = x ^ 2`   |
| `<<=`    | Left shift and assign           | `x <<= 1`     | `x = x << 1`  |
| `>>=`    | Right shift and assign          | `x >>= 1`     | `x = x >> 1`  |
| `>>>=`   | Unsigned right shift and assign | `x >>>= 1`    | `x = x >>> 1` |

---

## 4. Chained Assignment

- You can assign the same value to multiple variables in one statement.

```js
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 10;
```

---

## 5. Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use compound operators for concise code
- ❌ Don’t chain assignments unless clarity is maintained
- ✅ Use parentheses to clarify complex assignments

---

## 6. When to Use

- Use assignment operators for updating variable values
- Use compound operators for arithmetic and bitwise updates

---

## 7. Common Mistakes

- Confusing `=` (assignment) with `==` or `===` (equality)
- Overusing chained assignments, which can reduce readability

---

## Summary Table

| Operator | Description                     | Example   |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| =        | Assignment                      | x = 5     |
| +=       | Add and assign                  | x += 2    |
| -=       | Subtract and assign             | x -= 2    |
| \*=      | Multiply and assign             | x \*= 2   |
| /=       | Divide and assign               | x /= 2    |
| %=       | Modulus and assign              | x %= 2    |
| \*\*=    | Exponent and assign             | x \*\*= 2 |
| &=       | Bitwise AND and assign          | x &= 2    |
| \|=      | Bitwise OR and assign           | x \|= 2   |
| ^=       | Bitwise XOR and assign          | x ^= 2    |
| <<=      | Left shift and assign           | x <<= 1   |
| >>=      | Right shift and assign          | x >>= 1   |
| >>>=     | Unsigned right shift and assign | x >>>= 1  |

## Summary

- Assignment operators are essential for variable updates
- Use compound operators for concise and clear code
- Avoid confusing assignment with equality
