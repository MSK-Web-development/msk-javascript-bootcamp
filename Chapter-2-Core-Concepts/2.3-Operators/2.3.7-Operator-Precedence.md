# JavaScript Operator Precedence

Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. Understanding precedence is crucial for writing correct and predictable code.

## 1. What is Operator Precedence?

- When an expression contains multiple operators, JavaScript evaluates them in a specific order.
- Operators with higher precedence are evaluated before those with lower precedence.

## 2. Operator Precedence Table (Common Operators)

| Precedence  | Operator(s)                    | Description                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1 (highest) | `()`                           | Grouping (parentheses)            |
| 2           | `++`, `--`, `!`, `~`, `+`, `-` | Unary operators                   |
| 3           | `**`                           | Exponentiation                    |
| 4           | `*`, `/`, `%`                  | Multiplication, division, modulus |
| 5           | `+`, `-`                       | Addition, subtraction             |
| 6           | `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`              | Bitwise shifts                    |
| 7           | `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`           | Comparison                        |
| 8           | `==`, `!=`, `===`, `!==`       | Equality                          |
| 9           | `&`                            | Bitwise AND                       |
| 10          | `^`                            | Bitwise XOR                       |
| 11          | `                              | `                                 | Bitwise OR |
| 12          | `&&`                           | Logical AND                       |
| 13          | `                              |                                   | `          | Logical OR |
| 14          | `? :`                          | Ternary (conditional)             |
| 15          | `=`, `+=`, `-=` ...            | Assignment                        |
| 16 (lowest) | `,`                            | Comma                             |

## 3. Associativity

- **Left-to-right:** Most operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- **Right-to-left:** Assignment (`=`), exponentiation (`**`), ternary (`? :`)

### Example

```js
let a = 2,
  b = 3,
  c = 4;
let result = a + b * c; // 2 + (3 * 4) = 14
let x = 2 ** (3 ** 2); // 2 ** (3 ** 2) = 512
```

---

## 4. Using Parentheses

- Use parentheses `()` to explicitly specify evaluation order and improve readability.

```js
let y = (a + b) * c; // (2 + 3) * 4 = 20
```

---

## 5. Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use parentheses for clarity, especially in complex expressions
- ❌ Don’t rely solely on operator precedence for code readability

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Misunderstanding precedence, leading to unexpected results
- Forgetting associativity rules

---

## 7. When to Use

- Always use parentheses when in doubt
- For complex or nested expressions

---

## Summary

- Operator precedence controls evaluation order
- Use parentheses to avoid ambiguity
- Know associativity for correct results
