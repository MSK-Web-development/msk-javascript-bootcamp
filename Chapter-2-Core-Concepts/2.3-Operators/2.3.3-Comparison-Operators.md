# JavaScript Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a Boolean value (`true` or `false`). These operators are essential for control flow, conditions, and logic in JavaScript.

## 1. List of Comparison Operators

| Operator | Name                  | Example     | Result  |
| -------- | --------------------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              | `5 == '5'`  | `true`  |
| `===`    | Strict equal to       | `5 === '5'` | `false` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          | `5 != '5'`  | `false` |
| `!==`    | Strict not equal to   | `5 !== '5'` | `true`  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `5 > 3`     | `true`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `5 < 3`     | `false` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `5 >= 5`    | `true`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `5 <= 3`    | `false` |

## 2. Usage and Examples

### Equality (`==`) vs Strict Equality (`===`)

- `==` compares values after type coercion
- `===` compares both value and type (no coercion)

```js
5 == "5"; // true
5 === "5"; // false
5 === 5; // true
```

### Inequality (`!=`) vs Strict Inequality (`!==`)

```js
5 != "5"; // false
5 !== "5"; // true
```

### Greater/Less Than

```js
10 > 5; // true
10 < 5; // false
10 >= 10; // true
10 <= 5; // false
```

## 3. Comparing Different Types

- `==` can produce unexpected results due to type coercion:

```js
0 == false; // true
"" == false; // true
null == undefined; // true
```

- `===` is safer for most comparisons.

---

## 4. Do’s and Don’ts

- ✅ Use `===` and `!==` for most comparisons
- ❌ Don’t rely on `==` unless you understand type coercion
- ✅ Compare same types for predictable results

---

## 5. When to Use

- Use comparison operators in `if`, `while`, `for`, and ternary statements
- Use strict equality for type-safe checks

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

- Using `==` and getting unexpected results due to coercion
- Comparing objects or arrays with `==`/`===` (compares references, not values)

```js
[1,2] == [1,2]; // false
{a:1} === {a:1}; // false
```

## 7. Summary Table

| Operator | Description        | Example |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| ==       | Equal (loose)      | x == y  |
| ===      | Equal (strict)     | x === y |
| !=       | Not equal (loose)  | x != y  |
| !==      | Not equal (strict) | x !== y |
| >        | Greater than       | x > y   |
| <        | Less than          | x < y   |
| >=       | Greater or equal   | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less or equal      | x <= y  |

## Summary

- Comparison operators return Boolean values
- Prefer strict equality (`===`, `!==`) for reliability
- Be cautious with type coercion and reference comparisons
