# Creating Maps in JavaScript

A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where keys can be any data type. Maps are useful for storing data with unique keys and provide better performance for frequent additions and removals compared to plain objects.

## 1. Creating a Map

- **Empty Map:**
  ```js
  const map = new Map();
  ```
- **With Initial Values:**
  ```js
  const map = new Map([
    ["name", "Alice"],
    ["age", 25],
  ]);
  ```

---

## 2. Map Keys

- Can be any value (objects, functions, primitives).
  ```js
  const objKey = {};
  map.set(objKey, "Object as key");
  ```

## 3. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use Maps when you need keys of any type.
- **Do** use Maps for dynamic collections with frequent additions/removals.
- **Don't** use Maps for static, string-keyed data (use objects instead).

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- Using objects as keys: only the same object reference will match.
- Forgetting that Maps preserve insertion order.

Maps are powerful for advanced key-value storage. Practice creating and using them for flexible data structures!
