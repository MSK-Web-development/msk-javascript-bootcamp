# Creating Sets in JavaScript

A `Set` is a collection of unique values. Sets are useful for storing distinct items and for operations like deduplication.

---

## 1. Creating a Set

- **Empty Set:**
  ```js
  const set = new Set();
  ```
- **With Initial Values:**
  ```js
  const set = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3]); // {1, 2, 3}
  ```
  - Duplicate values are ignored.

---

## 2. Set Values

- Can be any data type (numbers, strings, objects, etc.).

---

## 3. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use Sets for unique collections.
- **Do** use Sets for deduplication.
- **Don't** use Sets if you need key-value pairs (use Map or Object).

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- Objects with the same content are different values in a Set.
- Sets do not support direct access by index.

Sets are ideal for storing unique values and performing set operations. Practice creating and using them for efficient data handling!
