# Local Storage in JavaScript

Local Storage is a Web Storage API that allows you to store key-value pairs in the browser with no expiration time.

---

## 1. Basic Usage

- Data persists even after the browser is closed.
- Storage limit is about 5MB per domain.

**Syntax:**

```js
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
localStorage.removeItem("key");
localStorage.clear(); // Removes all keys
```

---

## 2. Storing Objects

- Use `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` to store and retrieve objects.

```js
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify({ name: "Alice" }));
const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user"));
```

---

## 3. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use for persistent, non-sensitive data.
- **Don't** store sensitive information (not secure).

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- Storage is shared across all tabs/windows for the same origin.
- Only strings can be stored (use JSON for objects).

---

Local Storage is useful for saving user preferences, themes, and other persistent data.
