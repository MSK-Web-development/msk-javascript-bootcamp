# The Event Object in JavaScript

The event object provides information about the event and methods to control its behavior.

---

## 1. Accessing the Event Object

- The event object is passed as the first argument to event listener functions.

```js
element.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  console.log(event.type); // 'click'
});
```

---

## 2. Common Properties

| Property         | Description                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| type             | The event type (e.g., 'click')          |
| target           | The element that triggered the event    |
| currentTarget    | The element the listener is attached to |
| key, keyCode     | Keyboard event info                     |
| clientX, clientY | Mouse position                          |

---

## 3. Common Methods

- `preventDefault()`: Prevents default browser behavior.
- `stopPropagation()`: Stops the event from bubbling up.

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use the event object to get event details.
- **Don't** modify the event object unless necessary.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Confusing `target` and `currentTarget`.
- Forgetting to use `preventDefault` when needed.

---

The event object is key to handling events effectively in JavaScript.
