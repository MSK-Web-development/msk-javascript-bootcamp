# Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing

Event propagation determines the order in which event handlers are called in the DOM tree.

---

## 1. Bubbling Phase

- Events bubble up from the target element to the root.
- Most event listeners use bubbling by default.

**Example:**

```js
document.body.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("body"));
document
  .getElementById("child")
  .addEventListener("click", () => console.log("child"));
// Clicking #child logs 'child' then 'body'
```

---

## 2. Capturing Phase

- Events can be captured from the root down to the target.
- Use the third argument of `addEventListener` as `true` to listen during capturing.

**Example:**

```js
document.body.addEventListener("click", () => console.log("body"), true);
```

---

## 3. Stopping Propagation

- Use `event.stopPropagation()` to stop the event from moving further.

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** understand propagation to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Don't** overuse `stopPropagation` (can make debugging harder).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Not realizing both phases exist.
- Forgetting the default is bubbling.

---

Understanding event propagation is key to advanced event handling in the DOM.
