# Event Delegation in JavaScript

Event delegation is a technique where you use a single event listener on a parent element to handle events for multiple child elements.

---

## 1. How It Works

- Attach a listener to a common ancestor.
- Use `event.target` to determine which child triggered the event.

**Example:**

```js
document.getElementById("list").addEventListener("click", function (event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    alert("Item clicked: " + event.target.textContent);
  }
});
```

## 2. Use Cases

- Handling clicks on lists, tables, or dynamic content.

---

## 3. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use delegation for dynamic or large numbers of elements.
- **Don't** attach individual listeners to every child (hurts performance).

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- Not checking `event.target` properly.
- Delegating too broadly (catching unwanted events).

---

Event delegation is efficient and powerful for managing events on many elements.
