# DOM Manipulation Best Practices

Efficient and safe DOM manipulation is key to building fast, maintainable web applications.

---

## 1. Minimize DOM Access

- Accessing and updating the DOM is slow compared to working with JavaScript objects.
- Cache references to elements if used multiple times.

---

## 2. Batch DOM Updates

- Make multiple changes in memory, then update the DOM once.
- Use DocumentFragment for batch insertions.

**Example:**

```js
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  const li = document.createElement("li");
  li.textContent = `Item ${i}`;
  fragment.appendChild(li);
}
document.querySelector("ul").appendChild(fragment);
```

## 3. Avoid Layout Thrashing

- Reading and writing layout properties (like `offsetHeight`) in rapid succession can cause performance issues.
- Group reads and writes separately.

---

## 4. Use Classes for Styling

- Prefer adding/removing classes over setting inline styles for maintainability.

---

## 5. Clean Up Event Listeners

- Remove listeners when elements are removed to prevent memory leaks.

---

## 6. Security: Avoid XSS

- Never use `innerHTML` with untrusted content.
- Use `textContent` for plain text.

---

## 7. Accessibility

- Ensure dynamic changes are accessible (e.g., ARIA attributes, focus management).

---

## 8. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** minimize direct DOM manipulation.
- **Do** use best practices for performance and security.
- **Don't** ignore accessibility or security concerns.

Following best practices ensures your DOM code is fast, safe, and maintainable.
