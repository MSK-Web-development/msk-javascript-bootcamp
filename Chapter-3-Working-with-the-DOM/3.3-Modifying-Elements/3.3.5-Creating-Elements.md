# Creating Elements in the DOM

You can create new elements dynamically using JavaScript.

---

## 1. Creating an Element

- Use `document.createElement(tagName)`.

```js
const div = document.createElement("div");
div.textContent = "Hello!";
```

---

## 2. Setting Attributes and Content

- Set attributes, classes, or styles as needed.

```js
div.setAttribute("id", "myDiv");
div.classList.add("box");
```

---

## 3. Appending to the DOM

- Use `appendChild` or `append` to add the element to the document.

```js
document.body.appendChild(div);
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** create elements for dynamic content.
- **Don't** forget to append them to the DOM (they won't appear otherwise).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to set required attributes (like `src` for images).
- Not appending the element, so it never appears.

---

Creating elements dynamically is essential for interactive web applications.
