# Appending and Removing Elements in the DOM

You can add or remove elements from the DOM dynamically.

---

## 1. Appending Elements

- Use `appendChild` or `append` to add elements.

```js
parent.appendChild(child);
parent.append(newElement, anotherElement);
```

---

## 2. Removing Elements

- Use `removeChild` or `remove` to delete elements.

```js
parent.removeChild(child);
element.remove(); // Removes itself from the DOM
```

---

## 3. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use these methods for dynamic content.
- **Don't** forget to check if the parent exists before removing.

---

## 4. Common Pitfalls

- Removing an element that is not a child (throws error).
- Forgetting to update references after removal.

---

Appending and removing elements is key for dynamic, interactive web pages.
