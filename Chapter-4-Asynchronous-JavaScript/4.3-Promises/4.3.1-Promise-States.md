# Promise States in JavaScript

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Understanding its states is key to using Promises effectively.

## 1. The Three States

| State     | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| pending   | Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected |
| fulfilled | Operation completed successfully (resolved)   |
| rejected  | Operation failed (error occurred)             |

---

## 2. State Transitions

- A Promise starts as `pending`.
- It can transition to `fulfilled` (with a value) or `rejected` (with a reason).
- Once settled (fulfilled or rejected), it cannot change state again.

---

## 3. Example

```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
});

promise.then(
  (value) => console.log(value), // 'Success!'
  (error) => console.error(error)
);
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use Promises for async operations.
- **Don't** try to change the state after it is settled.

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Not handling rejection (always use `.catch()` or second argument to `.then()`).
- Forgetting that Promises are eager (executor runs immediately).

---

Understanding Promise states is fundamental for writing robust async code in JavaScript.
