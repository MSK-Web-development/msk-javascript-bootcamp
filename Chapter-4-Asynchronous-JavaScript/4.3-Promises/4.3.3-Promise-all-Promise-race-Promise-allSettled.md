# Promise.all, Promise.race, and Promise.allSettled in JavaScript

These static methods help manage multiple Promises concurrently.

---

## 1. Promise.all

- Waits for all Promises to resolve, or rejects if any fail.

```js
Promise.all([p1, p2, p3])
  .then((results) => console.log(results))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

- Resolves with an array of results.
- Rejects immediately if any Promise rejects.

---

## 2. Promise.race

- Resolves or rejects as soon as any Promise settles (first one wins).

```js
Promise.race([p1, p2, p3])
  .then((result) => console.log(result))
  .catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

---

## 3. Promise.allSettled (ES2020+)

- Waits for all Promises to settle (resolve or reject).
- Returns an array of objects describing the outcome of each Promise.

```js
Promise.allSettled([p1, p2, p3]).then((results) => console.log(results));
// [{status: 'fulfilled', value: ...}, {status: 'rejected', reason: ...}, ...]
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `Promise.all` when all results are needed.
- **Do** use `Promise.race` for timeouts or first-response wins.
- **Do** use `Promise.allSettled` to handle all outcomes.
- **Don't** forget that `Promise.all` fails fast (rejects on first error).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Not handling rejections in `Promise.all` (can cause unhandled errors).
- Expecting `Promise.race` to wait for all Promises (it doesn't).

---

These methods are essential for managing multiple async operations in parallel.
