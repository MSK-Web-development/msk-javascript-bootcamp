# Chaining Promises in JavaScript

Chaining allows you to run asynchronous operations in sequence, passing results from one `.then()` to the next.

---

## 1. Basic Chaining

- Each `.then()` returns a new Promise, enabling chaining.

```js
fetchData()
  .then((data) => process(data))
  .then((result) => display(result))
  .catch((error) => handleError(error));
```

---

## 2. Returning Values

- If you return a value from `.then()`, it becomes the input for the next `.then()`.
- If you return a Promise, the next `.then()` waits for it to resolve.

---

## 3. Error Handling

- Use `.catch()` at the end to handle errors from any step in the chain.
- You can also use multiple `.catch()` for granular error handling.

---

## 4. Example

```js
new Promise((resolve) => resolve(2))
  .then((x) => x * 2)
  .then((x) => x + 1)
  .then(console.log); // 5
```

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** chain Promises for sequential async operations.
- **Don't** nest `.then()` calls (defeats the purpose of chaining).

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to return from `.then()` (results in undefined in the next step).
- Not handling errors (always use `.catch()`).

---

Chaining Promises leads to cleaner, more readable async code compared to nested callbacks.
