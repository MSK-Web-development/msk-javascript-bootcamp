# setTimeout in JavaScript

`setTimeout` schedules a function to run once after a specified delay (in milliseconds).

---

## 1. Syntax

```js
setTimeout(function, delay, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

- `function`: The function to execute.
- `delay`: Time in milliseconds to wait before execution.
- `arg1, arg2, ...`: Optional arguments passed to the function.

---

## 2. Example

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Hello after 1 second");
}, 1000);
```

---

## 3. Storing the Timeout ID

- Returns a timeout ID, which can be used to cancel the timeout.

```js
const id = setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);
clearTimeout(id);
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use for delayed, one-time actions.
- **Don't** use for repeated actions (use `setInterval`).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to clear timeouts when not needed.
- Using string code as the first argument (not recommended).

---

`setTimeout` is essential for scheduling delayed actions in JavaScript.
