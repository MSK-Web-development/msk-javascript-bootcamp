# clearInterval in JavaScript

`clearInterval` cancels a repeated action established by `setInterval`.

---

## 1. Syntax

```js
clearInterval(intervalID);
```

- `intervalID`: The identifier returned by `setInterval`.

---

## 2. Example

```js
const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("This will not repeat");
}, 1000);
clearInterval(id);
```

---

## 3. Use Cases

- Stopping a repeated action when a condition is met (e.g., user stops a timer).

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** always store the interval ID if you may need to cancel it.
- **Don't** call `clearInterval` with an invalid ID (has no effect).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Not storing the interval ID, making it impossible to cancel.
- Trying to clear an interval after it has already been cleared (has no effect).

---

`clearInterval` is essential for managing repeated actions and preventing unwanted code execution.
