# clearTimeout in JavaScript

`clearTimeout` cancels a timeout previously established by `setTimeout`.

---

## 1. Syntax

```js
clearTimeout(timeoutID);
```

- `timeoutID`: The identifier returned by `setTimeout`.

---

## 2. Example

```js
const id = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This will not run");
}, 1000);
clearTimeout(id);
```

---

## 3. Use Cases

- Canceling a scheduled action if it is no longer needed (e.g., user interaction, cleanup).

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** always store the timeout ID if you may need to cancel it.
- **Don't** call `clearTimeout` with an invalid ID (has no effect).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Not storing the timeout ID, making it impossible to cancel.
- Trying to clear a timeout after it has already executed (has no effect).

---

`clearTimeout` is essential for managing scheduled actions and preventing unwanted code execution.
