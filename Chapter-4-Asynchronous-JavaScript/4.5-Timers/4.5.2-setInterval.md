# setInterval in JavaScript

`setInterval` schedules a function to run repeatedly at specified intervals (in milliseconds).

---

## 1. Syntax

```js
setInterval(function, interval, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

- `function`: The function to execute.
- `interval`: Time in milliseconds between executions.
- `arg1, arg2, ...`: Optional arguments passed to the function.

---

## 2. Example

```js
setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Runs every second");
}, 1000);
```

---

## 3. Storing the Interval ID

- Returns an interval ID, which can be used to cancel the interval.

```js
const id = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
clearInterval(id);
```

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use for repeated actions at regular intervals.
- **Don't** forget to clear intervals when no longer needed (can cause memory leaks).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Multiple intervals running unintentionally.
- Using string code as the first argument (not recommended).

---

`setInterval` is useful for polling, animations, and repeated tasks in JavaScript.
