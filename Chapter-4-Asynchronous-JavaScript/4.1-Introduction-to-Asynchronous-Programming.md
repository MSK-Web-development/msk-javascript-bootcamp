# Introduction to Asynchronous Programming in JavaScript

Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to perform tasks like network requests, timers, and file operations without blocking the main thread. This is essential for responsive web applications.

## 1. What is Asynchronous Programming?

- Code that runs independently of the main program flow.
- Allows other code to execute while waiting for long-running tasks.

---

## 2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous

| Synchronous              | Asynchronous             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Blocks further execution | Does not block execution |
| Runs in order            | Can run out of order     |
| Example: `alert()`       | Example: `setTimeout()`  |

## 3. Why Use Asynchronous Code?

- Improves performance and user experience.
- Handles tasks like API calls, file reading, and timers efficiently.

---

## 4. Common Asynchronous Patterns

- Callbacks
- Promises
- Async/Await
- Event Listeners

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use async patterns for I/O, network, and timers.
- **Don't** block the main thread with long-running synchronous code.

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Callback hell (deeply nested callbacks).
- Not handling errors in async code.

Asynchronous programming is fundamental for modern JavaScript. Mastering it is key to building fast, interactive applications.
