# 4.6.4 Request Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

HTTP request methods define the action to be performed for a given resource. The Fetch API supports all standard HTTP methods, allowing you to interact with APIs in various ways.

## Common HTTP Methods

| Method | Description                                | Typical Use Case                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| GET    | Retrieve data from the server              | Fetching data, queries               |
| POST   | Send new data to the server                | Creating resources, submitting forms |
| PUT    | Update/replace existing data on the server | Updating resources                   |
| DELETE | Remove data from the server                | Deleting resources                   |

## Basic Syntax

```js
fetch(url, {
  method: 'METHOD', // e.g., 'GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'
  headers: { ... },
  body: ... // Only for POST, PUT, PATCH
});
```

## GET Request Example

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- **Notes:**
  - No body is sent with GET requests.
  - Use query parameters for filtering/searching.

## POST Request Example

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/items", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: "New Item", price: 10 }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- **Notes:**
  - Use POST to create new resources.
  - Always set the `Content-Type` header when sending JSON or form data.

## PUT Request Example

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/items/1", {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name: "Updated Item", price: 12 }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

- **Notes:**
  - PUT replaces the entire resource.
  - Use PATCH for partial updates (not covered here).

## DELETE Request Example

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/items/1", {
  method: "DELETE",
}).then((response) => {
  if (response.ok) {
    console.log("Item deleted");
  }
});
```

- **Notes:**
  - DELETE requests usually do not have a body.

## Tips, Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use the correct method for the intended action.
- **Do**: Set headers and body only when required (e.g., POST, PUT).
- **Don't**: Send a body with GET or DELETE requests (unless the API explicitly allows it).
- **Do**: Check the API documentation for method support and requirements.
- **Don't**: Assume all servers support all methods (some may restrict PUT/DELETE).

## When to Use Each Method

- **GET**: When you want to retrieve data without side effects.
- **POST**: When you want to create a new resource.
- **PUT**: When you want to completely replace an existing resource.
- **DELETE**: When you want to remove a resource.

## Notes

- Some APIs may use POST for actions other than creation (check docs).
- PUT and DELETE may require authentication.
- CORS policies may restrict certain methods.

## Summary

- HTTP methods define the action for a Fetch request.
- Use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE appropriately for CRUD operations.
- Always check API documentation for method support and requirements.
- Set headers and body as needed for each method.
