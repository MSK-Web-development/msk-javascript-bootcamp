# The Await Operator in JavaScript

The `await` operator is used inside async functions to pause execution until a Promise settles (resolves or rejects).

---

## 1. Basic Usage

- Use `await` before a Promise to get its resolved value.

```js
async function getData() {
  const result = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  const data = await result.json();
  return data;
}
```

---

## 2. Sequential vs Parallel Awaits

- Sequential: Each `await` waits for the previous one.
- Parallel: Start Promises first, then `await` them.

```js
// Sequential
const a = await fetchA();
const b = await fetchB();

// Parallel
const promiseA = fetchA();
const promiseB = fetchB();
const a = await promiseA;
const b = await promiseB;
```

## 3. Awaiting Non-Promises

- If the value is not a Promise, `await` returns it immediately.

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use `await` for readable async code.
- **Don't** use `await` outside of async functions (causes syntax error).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Using `await` in loops (can be slow; use `Promise.all` for parallelism).
- Not handling errors (use try/catch).

---

`await` makes asynchronous code look synchronous, improving readability and maintainability.
