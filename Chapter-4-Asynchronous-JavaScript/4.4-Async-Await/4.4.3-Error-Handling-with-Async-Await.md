# Error Handling with Async/Await in JavaScript

Handling errors in async/await code is crucial for robust asynchronous programming.

---

## 1. Using try/catch

- Wrap `await` calls in a `try/catch` block to handle errors.

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Fetch error:", error);
    throw error; // rethrow if needed
  }
}
```

---

## 2. Error Propagation

- Errors thrown inside async functions are returned as rejected Promises.
- You can handle them with `.catch()` when calling the async function.

```js
fetchData().catch((error) => console.error(error));
```

---

## 3. Multiple Awaits

- Use separate `try/catch` blocks for granular error handling, or a single block for all.

---

## 4. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** always handle errors in async functions.
- **Don't** ignore rejected Promises (can cause unhandled rejection warnings).

---

## 5. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to use `try/catch` (uncaught errors become rejected Promises).
- Not rethrowing errors when needed (can hide bugs).

---

Proper error handling with async/await ensures your async code is safe and predictable.
