# Callbacks in JavaScript

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later. Callbacks are a fundamental pattern for asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax

```js
function doSomethingAsync(callback) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    callback("Done!");
  }, 1000);
}

doSomethingAsync(function (result) {
  console.log(result); // 'Done!'
});
```

---

## 2. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Callbacks

- **Synchronous:** Called immediately (e.g., array methods like `forEach`).
- **Asynchronous:** Called later (e.g., after a timer, network request).

---

## 3. Error-First Callbacks (Node.js Style)

- Convention: first argument is error, second is result.

```js
function readFile(path, callback) {
  // ...existing code...
  callback(null, data); // success
  // or
  callback(error); // error
}
```

---

## 4. Callback Hell

- Deeply nested callbacks make code hard to read and maintain.
- Solution: Use named functions, modularize code, or use Promises/Async-Await.

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use callbacks for async operations.
- **Don't** nest too many callbacks (refactor or use Promises).

---

## 6. Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to handle errors in callbacks.
- Losing context (`this`) inside callbacks (use arrow functions or `bind`).

---

Callbacks are the foundation of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. Master them to handle async tasks effectively!
