# 5.1 Closures in JavaScript

Closures are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow functions to access variables from their outer (enclosing) scope even after that scope has finished executing. Mastering closures is essential for writing advanced, efficient, and modular JavaScript code.

## What is a Closure?

A **closure** is created when a function is defined inside another function, allowing the inner function to access the outer function’s variables.

### Basic Example

```js
function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  function inner() {
    count++;
    return count;
  }
  return inner;
}

const counter = outer();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

- Here, `inner` forms a closure over `count` from `outer`.

---

## How Closures Work

- When a function is returned or passed, it “remembers” the environment in which it was created.
- The closed-over variables are kept alive as long as the closure exists.

### Visual Representation

```
outer() scope: [count]
  ↳ inner() scope: [has access to count]
```

## Common Uses of Closures

- **Data privacy/encapsulation**
- **Factory functions**
- **Callbacks and event handlers**
- **Partial application and currying**
- **Memoization**

### Example: Data Privacy

```js
function secretHolder(secret) {
  return {
    getSecret: function () {
      return secret;
    },
    setSecret: function (newSecret) {
      secret = newSecret;
    },
  };
}

const holder = secretHolder("abc");
console.log(holder.getSecret()); // 'abc'
holder.setSecret("xyz");
console.log(holder.getSecret()); // 'xyz'
```

---

## Closures in Loops

Be careful when using closures inside loops:

```js
var funcs = [];
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs.push(function () {
    return i;
  });
}
console.log(funcs[0]()); // 3 (not 0!)
```

**Why?** All functions share the same `i` (from the outer scope).

**Solution:** Use `let` or IIFE:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs.push(function () {
    return i;
  });
}
```

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use closures for data privacy and modular code.
- **Do**: Be mindful of memory leaks (closures keep variables alive).
- **Don't**: Overuse closures for simple tasks.
- **Don't**: Forget about variable capture in loops.

---

## Tips

- Closures are created every time a function is created inside another function.
- Use `let` or `const` in loops to avoid common closure bugs.
- Closures can help you write more functional, reusable code.

---

## Notes

- Closures are the basis for many advanced JavaScript patterns.
- They are used in event handlers, callbacks, and module patterns.
- Understanding closures helps with debugging and memory management.

---

## Summary

- Closures allow inner functions to access outer variables even after the outer function has finished.
- They are powerful for encapsulation, callbacks, and advanced patterns.
- Use closures wisely for clean, maintainable code.
