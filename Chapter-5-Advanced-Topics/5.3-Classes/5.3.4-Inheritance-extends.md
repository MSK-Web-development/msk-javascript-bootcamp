# 5.3.4 Inheritance with `extends` in JavaScript Classes

Inheritance allows one class to acquire the properties and methods of another. In JavaScript, the `extends` keyword is used to create a subclass (child) that inherits from a superclass (parent).

---

## Basic Syntax

```js
class Parent {
  greet() {
    return "Hello from Parent";
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  greetChild() {
    return "Hello from Child";
  }
}

const c = new Child();
console.log(c.greet()); // 'Hello from Parent'
console.log(c.greetChild()); // 'Hello from Child'
```

---

## How Inheritance Works

- The subclass inherits all methods and properties from the superclass.
- You can override superclass methods in the subclass.

### Overriding Methods

```js
class Animal {
  speak() {
    return "Animal sound";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return "Woof!";
  }
}

const d = new Dog();
console.log(d.speak()); // 'Woof!'
```

---

## Calling the Parent Constructor

- Use `super()` in the subclass constructor to call the parent’s constructor.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    super(name); // Call parent constructor
    this.grade = grade;
  }
}
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use `extends` for clear inheritance hierarchies.
- **Do**: Use `super()` to access parent methods and constructors.
- **Don't**: Forget to call `super()` in subclass constructors before using `this`.
- **Don't**: Overuse inheritance—prefer composition for flexibility.

---

## Tips

- You can use `super.methodName()` to call parent methods.
- Subclasses can add or override methods and properties.
- Use inheritance for “is-a” relationships.

---

## Notes

- Only one class can be extended (no multiple inheritance).
- Inheritance works with both built-in and user-defined classes.

---

## Summary

- Use `extends` to create subclasses that inherit from parent classes.
- Use `super()` to call parent constructors and methods.
- Inheritance enables code reuse and logical hierarchies in your code.
