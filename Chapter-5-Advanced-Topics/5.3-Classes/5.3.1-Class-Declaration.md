# 5.3.1 Class Declaration in JavaScript

JavaScript classes, introduced in ES6, provide a clearer and more concise syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance. Classes are syntactic sugar over JavaScriptâ€™s existing prototype-based inheritance.

---

## Declaring a Class

Use the `class` keyword to declare a class:

```js
class Person {
  // class body
}
```

---

## Class Expressions

Classes can also be defined as expressions and assigned to variables:

```js
const Animal = class {
  // class body
};
```

---

## Named vs. Anonymous Class Expressions

```js
const MyClass = class NamedClass {
  // ...
};
```

- The class name is local to the class body.

---

## Hoisting

- Class declarations are **not** hoisted. You must declare a class before using it.

```js
const p = new Person(); // ReferenceError
class Person {}
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use classes for object-oriented code and inheritance.
- **Don't**: Use classes where simple objects or functions suffice.
- **Don't**: Forget that classes are not hoisted.

---

## Tips

- Classes can have constructors, methods, getters/setters, and static members.
- Use PascalCase for class names by convention.

---

## Notes

- Classes are just special functions under the hood.
- All methods are non-enumerable by default.

---

## Summary

- Use the `class` keyword to declare classes in JavaScript.
- Classes provide a clean, modern syntax for object-oriented programming.
- Remember that class declarations are not hoisted.
