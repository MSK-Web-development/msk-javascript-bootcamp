# 5.3.7 Getters and Setters in JavaScript Classes

Getters and setters are special methods that allow you to define how properties are accessed and set on class instances. They provide a way to control, validate, or compute property values dynamically.

---

## Defining Getters and Setters

Use the `get` and `set` keywords inside the class body:

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }
  get name() {
    return this._name.toUpperCase();
  }
  set name(value) {
    if (value.length < 2) throw new Error("Name too short");
    this._name = value;
  }
}

const p = new Person("Alice");
console.log(p.name); // 'ALICE'
p.name = "Bob";
console.log(p.name); // 'BOB'
```

---

## Why Use Getters and Setters?

- Encapsulate internal data
- Add validation or transformation logic
- Compute properties dynamically
- Provide a property-like interface for methods

---

## Tips

- Use a naming convention (like `_property`) for backing fields to avoid recursion.
- Getters/setters can be used with both classes and plain objects.
- You can define only a getter, only a setter, or both.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use getters/setters for computed or validated properties.
- **Do**: Use them to hide internal implementation details.
- **Don't**: Overuse for simple propertiesâ€”direct access is fine for plain data.
- **Don't**: Cause side effects in getters (keep them pure).

---

## Notes

- Getters and setters are accessed like properties, not methods.
- They are non-enumerable by default.

---

## Summary

- Getters and setters provide controlled access to class properties.
- Use them for validation, transformation, and computed values.
- They help encapsulate and protect internal state in your classes.
