# 5.3.3 Methods in JavaScript Classes

Methods are functions defined inside a class and are used to define the behavior of class instances. They are a core part of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

---

## Defining Methods

Methods are defined inside the class body, without the `function` keyword:

```js
class Person {
  greet() {
    return "Hello!";
  }
}

const p = new Person();
console.log(p.greet()); // 'Hello!'
```

---

## Instance Methods vs. Prototype Methods

- All methods defined in a class are placed on the prototype of the class.
- All instances share the same method definitions (memory efficient).

---

## Method Parameters and Return Values

Methods can take parameters and return values like regular functions:

```js
class Calculator {
  add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

const calc = new Calculator();
console.log(calc.add(2, 3)); // 5
```

---

## Method Shorthand

No `function` keyword is needed inside classes:

```js
class Example {
  sayHi() {
    return "Hi";
  }
}
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use methods to define shared behavior for class instances.
- **Don't**: Use arrow functions for class methods if you need prototype inheritance.
- **Don't**: Define methods in the constructor (use the class body instead).

---

## Tips

- Use methods for actions related to the class instance.
- Methods can call other methods using `this`.
- Use getters/setters for computed properties (see next section).

---

## Notes

- Methods are non-enumerable by default.
- Methods are not hoisted.

---

## Summary

- Methods define the behavior of class instances.
- Define methods inside the class body for shared, memory-efficient code.
- Use methods for actions and logic related to the class.
