# 5.3.2 Constructor in JavaScript Classes

The `constructor` method is a special function for creating and initializing objects created with a class. It is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.

---

## Syntax

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}

const p = new Person("Alice", 30);
console.log(p.name); // 'Alice'
```

---

## Key Points

- Each class can have only one `constructor` method.
- If you do not specify a constructor, a default is used.
- The constructor can use parameters to initialize instance properties.
- In derived classes (using `extends`), you must call `super()` before using `this`.

---

## Example: Derived Class

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Call parent constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}

const d = new Dog("Rex", "Labrador");
console.log(d.name); // 'Rex'
console.log(d.breed); // 'Labrador'
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use the constructor to initialize instance properties.
- **Do**: Call `super()` in derived class constructors before using `this`.
- **Don't**: Define more than one constructor per class.
- **Don't**: Forget to call `super()` in subclasses.

---

## Tips

- You can omit the constructor if you donâ€™t need custom initialization.
- Use default parameter values for flexibility.

---

## Notes

- The constructor is not inherited; each class defines its own.
- The constructor can return an object, but this is rare.

---

## Summary

- The `constructor` method initializes new class instances.
- Use it to set up properties and perform setup logic.
- Always call `super()` in subclass constructors before using `this`.
