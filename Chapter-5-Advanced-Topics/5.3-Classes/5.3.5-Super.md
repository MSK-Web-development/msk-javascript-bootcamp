# 5.3.5 The `super` Keyword in JavaScript Classes

The `super` keyword is used in classes to access and call functions on an object's parent. It is essential for working with inheritance in ES6 classes.

---

## Using `super` in Constructors

- In a subclass constructor, `super()` must be called before using `this`.
- `super()` calls the parent class's constructor.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name); // Calls Animal's constructor
    this.breed = breed;
  }
}
```

---

## Using `super` in Methods

- Use `super.methodName()` to call a method from the parent class.

```js
class Parent {
  greet() {
    return "Hello from Parent";
  }
}

class Child extends Parent {
  greet() {
    return super.greet() + " and Child";
  }
}

const c = new Child();
console.log(c.greet()); // 'Hello from Parent and Child'
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Always call `super()` in subclass constructors before using `this`.
- **Do**: Use `super.methodName()` to extend or override parent methods.
- **Don't**: Call `super()` in a class that does not extend another class.
- **Don't**: Forget to call `super()` in derived class constructors.

---

## Tips

- You can use `super` in both instance and static methods.
- Use `super` to avoid code duplication when extending classes.

---

## Notes

- `super` is only valid inside class constructors and methods.
- In static methods, `super` refers to the parent class itself.

---

## Summary

- Use `super()` to call parent constructors in subclasses.
- Use `super.methodName()` to call parent methods.
- `super` is essential for proper inheritance and method overriding in ES6 classes.
