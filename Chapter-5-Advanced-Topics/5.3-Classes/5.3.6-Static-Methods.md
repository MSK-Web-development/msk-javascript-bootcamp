# 5.3.6 Static Methods in JavaScript Classes

Static methods are functions defined on the class itself, not on instances of the class. They are useful for utility functions, factory methods, or any functionality that does not depend on instance data.

---

## Defining Static Methods

Use the `static` keyword inside the class body:

```js
class MathUtils {
  static add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.add(2, 3)); // 5
```

---

## Accessing Static Methods

- Call static methods on the class, not on instances.
- Static methods are not available on class instances.

```js
const m = new MathUtils();
console.log(typeof m.add); // 'undefined'
```

---

## Use Cases

- Utility/helper functions
- Factory methods
- Caching or registry management

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use static methods for logic that doesnâ€™t depend on instance data.
- **Do**: Use static methods for class-level operations.
- **Don't**: Access `this` as an instance inside static methods (it refers to the class itself).
- **Don't**: Try to call static methods on instances.

---

## Tips

- Static methods can be inherited by subclasses.
- Use `super` in static methods to call parent static methods.

---

## Notes

- Static methods are often used for utility or factory patterns.
- They are not part of the prototype chain for instances.

---

## Summary

- Static methods belong to the class, not instances.
- Use them for utility, factory, or class-level logic.
- Access static methods via the class, not via instances.
