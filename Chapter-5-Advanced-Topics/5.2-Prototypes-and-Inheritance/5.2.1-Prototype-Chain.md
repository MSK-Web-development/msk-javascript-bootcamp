# 5.2.1 Prototype Chain in JavaScript

The prototype chain is a core concept in JavaScript’s inheritance model. It allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, enabling code reuse and dynamic property lookup.

---

## What is the Prototype Chain?

- Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its **prototype**.
- When you access a property or method, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself. If not found, it looks up the prototype chain until it finds it or reaches `null`.

### Visual Example

```
myObject → MyConstructor.prototype → Object.prototype → null
```

---

## How the Prototype Chain Works

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  return this.name + " makes a noise.";
};

const dog = new Animal("Rex");
console.log(dog.speak()); // 'Rex makes a noise.'
console.log(dog.toString()); // Inherited from Object.prototype
```

- `dog` does not have `speak` directly, but finds it via `Animal.prototype`.
- If not found there, JavaScript checks `Object.prototype`.

---

## Inspecting the Prototype Chain

- Use `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` or `__proto__` (not recommended for production).

```js
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(dog) === Animal.prototype); // true
console.log(dog.__proto__ === Animal.prototype); // true
```

---

## Prototype Chain Depth

- The chain can be as long as needed, but usually ends at `Object.prototype`.
- If a property is not found anywhere in the chain, `undefined` is returned.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use prototypes for shared methods and properties.
- **Don't**: Modify `Object.prototype` (can break built-in behavior).
- **Do**: Use `Object.create()` for custom prototype chains.
- **Don't**: Overcomplicate the chain—keep it simple for maintainability.

---

## Tips

- All functions have a `prototype` property (used when creating objects with `new`).
- Use `hasOwnProperty` to check if a property exists directly on an object.

---

## Notes

- The prototype chain is dynamic; changes to prototypes are reflected in all linked objects.
- ES6 classes use prototypes under the hood.

---

## Summary

- The prototype chain enables inheritance and property lookup in JavaScript.
- Understanding it is key to mastering objects and inheritance patterns.
