# 5.2.2 Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript

Prototypal inheritance is the mechanism by which objects in JavaScript inherit properties and methods from other objects. Unlike classical inheritance (as in Java or C++), JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance.

---

## What is Prototypal Inheritance?

- Objects can serve as prototypes for other objects.
- When a property or method is not found on an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain.

### Example: Manual Inheritance

```js
const animal = {
  speak() {
    return "Animal sound";
  },
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function () {
  return "Woof!";
};

console.log(dog.speak()); // 'Animal sound' (inherited)
console.log(dog.bark()); // 'Woof!'
```

---

## Constructor Functions and Inheritance

```js
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Animal.prototype.speak = function () {
  return this.name + " makes a noise.";
};

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Inherit properties
}
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Inherit methods
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

Dog.prototype.bark = function () {
  return this.name + " barks!";
};

const rex = new Dog("Rex");
console.log(rex.speak()); // 'Rex makes a noise.'
console.log(rex.bark()); // 'Rex barks!'
```

---

## ES6 Classes and Prototypal Inheritance

ES6 classes use prototypal inheritance under the hood.

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  speak() {
    return this.name + " makes a noise.";
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    return this.name + " barks!";
  }
}

const dog = new Dog("Buddy");
console.log(dog.speak()); // 'Buddy makes a noise.'
console.log(dog.bark()); // 'Buddy barks!'
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use `Object.create()` for simple inheritance.
- **Do**: Use ES6 classes for cleaner, more readable code.
- **Don't**: Modify built-in prototypes (like `Array.prototype`).
- **Don't**: Overuse inheritanceâ€”prefer composition when possible.

---

## Tips

- Prototypal inheritance is dynamic; changes to the prototype are reflected in all inheriting objects.
- Use `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` to inspect an object's prototype.
- Use `instanceof` to check inheritance relationships.

---

## Notes

- All objects except the root (`Object.prototype`) have a prototype.
- Inheritance can be single-level or multi-level (deep chains).

---

## Summary

- Prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit from other objects.
- Use `Object.create()` or ES6 classes for inheritance.
- Prefer composition over deep inheritance chains for maintainability.
