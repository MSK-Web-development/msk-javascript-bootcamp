# 5.5.1 Proxies in JavaScript

A Proxy in JavaScript is an object that wraps another object (the target) and intercepts operations performed on it, such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, and more. Proxies enable powerful metaprogramming capabilities, allowing you to define custom behavior for fundamental operations.

---

## Basic Syntax

```js
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
```

- `target`: The original object to wrap.
- `handler`: An object with trap methods that define custom behavior.

---

## Example: Logging Property Access

```js
const user = { name: "Alice" };
const handler = {
  get(target, prop) {
    console.log(`Getting ${prop}`);
    return target[prop];
  },
};
const proxyUser = new Proxy(user, handler);
console.log(proxyUser.name); // Logs: Getting name, then 'Alice'
```

## Common Traps

| Trap             | Description                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `get`            | Intercept property access     |
| `set`            | Intercept property assignment |
| `has`            | Intercept `in` operator       |
| `deleteProperty` | Intercept `delete` operator   |
| `apply`          | Intercept function calls      |
| `construct`      | Intercept `new` operator      |

---

## Example: Validation with `set`

```js
const person = {};
const handler = {
  set(target, prop, value) {
    if (prop === "age" && typeof value !== "number") {
      throw new TypeError("Age must be a number");
    }
    target[prop] = value;
    return true;
  },
};
const proxyPerson = new Proxy(person, handler);
proxyPerson.age = 30; // OK
// proxyPerson.age = 'thirty'; // Throws error
```

---

## Use Cases

- Data validation
- Property access logging
- Creating observable objects
- Implementing default values
- Virtualized or computed properties

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use proxies for cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, etc.).
- **Do**: Keep handler logic efficient to avoid performance issues.
- **Don't**: Overuse proxies for simple tasksâ€”prefer plain objects when possible.
- **Don't**: Forget that proxies can break identity checks (`proxy !== target`).

---

## Tips

- Proxies can wrap any object, including functions and arrays.
- You can nest proxies for layered behavior.
- Use proxies for advanced API design and libraries.

---

## Notes

- Not all built-in operations are trapable (e.g., some internal slots).
- Proxies are supported in all modern browsers and Node.js.

---

## Summary

- Proxies allow you to intercept and customize fundamental operations on objects.
- Use them for validation, logging, and advanced metaprogramming patterns.
- Proxies are a powerful tool, but use them judiciously for maintainable code.
