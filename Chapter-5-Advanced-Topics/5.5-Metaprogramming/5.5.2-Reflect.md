# 5.5.2 Reflect API in JavaScript

The Reflect API is a built-in object that provides methods for interceptable JavaScript operations, mirroring many of the methods that can be trapped by Proxies. It offers a standardized way to perform low-level object operations and is useful for metaprogramming.

---

## What is the Reflect API?

- Reflect is a static object (not a constructor) with methods for manipulating objects, properties, and functions.
- Methods in Reflect correspond to Proxy traps, making it easy to forward operations from a Proxy handler.

## Common Reflect Methods

| Method                   | Description                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Reflect.get`            | Get a property value                       |
| `Reflect.set`            | Set a property value                       |
| `Reflect.has`            | Check if a property exists (`in` operator) |
| `Reflect.deleteProperty` | Delete a property                          |
| `Reflect.apply`          | Call a function with a given `this`/args   |
| `Reflect.construct`      | Call a constructor with arguments          |
| `Reflect.ownKeys`        | Get all property keys (own + symbols)      |
| `Reflect.defineProperty` | Define a property                          |
| `Reflect.getPrototypeOf` | Get an object's prototype                  |
| `Reflect.setPrototypeOf` | Set an object's prototype                  |

## Example: Using Reflect with Proxies

```js
const handler = {
  get(target, prop, receiver) {
    console.log(`Accessing ${prop}`);
    return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
  },
};
const obj = { x: 10 };
const proxy = new Proxy(obj, handler);
console.log(proxy.x); // Logs: Accessing x, then 10
```

---

## Why Use Reflect?

- Provides a functional, consistent API for object operations
- Avoids side effects of older methods (like `Object.defineProperty`)
- Useful for forwarding operations in Proxy handlers
- Improves code clarity and maintainability

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use Reflect methods in Proxy handlers for default behavior.
- **Do**: Use Reflect for advanced object manipulation.
- **Don't**: Use Reflect as a constructor (it's not one).
- **Don't**: Overuse Reflect for simple property accessâ€”dot notation is fine for most cases.

---

## Tips

- Reflect methods return a boolean or the result of the operation, making error handling easier.
- Use `Reflect.ownKeys()` to get all property keys, including symbols.

---

## Notes

- Reflect is available in all modern browsers and Node.js.
- It is part of ES6 and later.

---

## Summary

- The Reflect API provides methods for low-level object operations.
- It complements Proxies and is useful for metaprogramming.
- Use Reflect for advanced, consistent, and maintainable code.
