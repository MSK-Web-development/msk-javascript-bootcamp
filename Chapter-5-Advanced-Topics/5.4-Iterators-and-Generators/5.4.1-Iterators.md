# 5.4.1 Iterators in JavaScript

Iterators are objects that allow you to traverse through a collection (like arrays, strings, maps, etc.) one element at a time. They are a key part of the ES6 iteration protocols.

---

## What is an Iterator?

An **iterator** is an object with a `next()` method that returns an object with two properties:

- `value`: The next value in the sequence
- `done`: Boolean, true if the sequence is finished

### Example: Manual Iterator

```js
const arr = [10, 20, 30];
const iterator = arr[Symbol.iterator]();

console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 10, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 20, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: 30, done: false }
console.log(iterator.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

---

## Creating a Custom Iterator

You can create your own iterator by defining a `next()` method:

```js
const myIterator = {
  current: 1,
  last: 3,
  next() {
    if (this.current <= this.last) {
      return { value: this.current++, done: false };
    } else {
      return { value: undefined, done: true };
    }
  },
};

console.log(myIterator.next()); // { value: 1, done: false }
```

---

## Iterator Protocol

- Any object with a `next()` method that returns `{ value, done }` is an iterator.
- Iterators are consumed one value at a time.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use iterators for custom data structures.
- **Do**: Use built-in iterators for arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
- **Don't**: Forget to check the `done` property.
- **Don't**: Mutate the collection while iterating.

---

## Tips

- Iterators are the foundation for `for...of` loops and generators.
- You can pause and resume iteration using the iterator object.

---

## Notes

- Iterators are not limited to arrays; any object can be made iterable.
- Iterators are a low-level API; use higher-level constructs when possible.

---

## Summary

- Iterators provide a standard way to traverse collections in JavaScript.
- They are used by many built-in and custom objects for iteration.
- Understanding iterators is key to mastering advanced iteration patterns.
