# 5.7.1 Creating Regular Expressions in JavaScript

Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In JavaScript, you can create regular expressions using two syntaxes: literal and constructor.

---

## 1. Regular Expression Literal

Use forward slashes to define the pattern:

```js
const regex = /abc/;
```

- The pattern is compiled when the script is loaded.

---

## 2. RegExp Constructor

Use the `RegExp` constructor for dynamic patterns:

```js
const regex = new RegExp("abc");
const regexWithFlags = new RegExp("abc", "i"); // case-insensitive
```

- Useful when the pattern is not known until runtime.

---

## 3. Flags

Flags modify regex behavior:
| Flag | Name | Description |
|------|----------------|------------------------------|
| g | global | Match all occurrences |
| i | ignoreCase | Case-insensitive match |
| m | multiline | ^ and $ match line breaks |
| s | dotAll | . matches newline |
| u | unicode | Unicode matching |
| y | sticky | Match at lastIndex only |

Example:

```js
const regex = /abc/gi;
```

---

## 4. Escaping Special Characters

Escape special characters with `\`:

```js
const regex = /a\+b/; // matches 'a+b'
```

---

## 5. Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use regex literals for static patterns.
- **Do**: Use the constructor for dynamic patterns.
- **Don't**: Forget to escape special characters.
- **Don't**: Overuse complex regex—prefer clarity.

---

## 6. Tips

- Test your regex with online tools (e.g., regex101.com).
- Use comments and whitespace with the `x` flag (not supported in JS, but split long regex for readability).

---

## 7. Notes

- Regexes are objects; you can use methods like `.test()` and `.exec()`.
- Regexes are immutable—modifying requires creating a new one.

---

## 8. Summary

- Create regex with literals or the `RegExp` constructor.
- Use flags to control matching behavior.
- Escape special characters and keep patterns readable.
