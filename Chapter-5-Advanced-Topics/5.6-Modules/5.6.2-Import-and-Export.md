# 5.6.2 Import and Export in ES Modules

The `import` and `export` statements are the foundation of ES Modules, enabling you to share and reuse code across files in a clean, maintainable way.

---

## Exporting

You can export variables, functions, or classes from a module using `export`:

### Named Exports

```js
// math.js
export const PI = 3.14159;
export function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

### Default Export

```js
// logger.js
export default function log(msg) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

---

## Importing

You can import exported members into another module using `import`:

### Importing Named Exports

```js
import { PI, multiply } from "./math.js";
console.log(multiply(2, PI));
```

### Importing Default Export

```js
import log from "./logger.js";
log("Hello!");
```

### Importing All as Namespace

```js
import * as math from "./math.js";
console.log(math.PI);
console.log(math.multiply(2, 3));
```

---

## Renaming Imports and Exports

You can rename exports and imports using `as`:

```js
// math.js
export { PI as piValue };

// app.js
import { piValue } from "./math.js";
```

---

## Re-exporting

You can re-export from another module:

```js
export { multiply } from "./math.js";
export * from "./math.js";
```

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Use named exports for utility functions and constants.
- **Do**: Use default export for the main functionality of a module.
- **Don't**: Import unused exports (tree-shaking works best with named exports).
- **Don't**: Mix CommonJS and ES Module syntax in the same file.

---

## Tips

- Imports are static and hoisted; you cannot import conditionally.
- Use file extensions (`.js`, `.mjs`) as required by your environment.
- Use `export default` for a single main export per file.

---

## Notes

- Circular imports are allowed but can lead to undefined values if not handled carefully.
- Imports are read-only views of the exported value.

---

## Summary

- Use `export` and `import` to share code between modules.
- Prefer named exports for utilities, default export for main functionality.
- ES Modules make code organization and reuse easy and robust.
