# 5.8.2 Memory Leaks in JavaScript

A memory leak occurs when memory that is no longer needed is not released, causing the application's memory usage to grow over time. In JavaScript, memory leaks can lead to performance issues and crashes, especially in long-running applications.

---

## Common Causes of Memory Leaks

- **Global variables:** Accidentally creating variables in the global scope.
- **Forgotten timers/callbacks:** Not clearing intervals, timeouts, or event listeners.
- **Detached DOM nodes:** Keeping references to DOM elements that are removed from the document.
- **Closures:** Unintentionally retaining references to variables in closures.
- **Caches:** Growing data structures (arrays, objects, maps) that are never cleaned up.

## Examples

### 1. Global Variable Leak

```js
function foo() {
  leak = "I am global!"; // Missing 'var', 'let', or 'const'
}
foo();
// 'leak' is now a global variable and won't be garbage collected
```

### 2. Detached DOM Node

```js
let node = document.getElementById("myDiv");
document.body.removeChild(node);
// 'node' still references the DOM element, preventing GC
```

### 3. Forgotten Timer

```js
const id = setInterval(() => {
  // ...
}, 1000);
// If not cleared, the interval keeps running and retains references
```

## How to Detect Memory Leaks

- Use browser dev tools (Memory tab in Chrome DevTools)
- Monitor heap snapshots and memory usage over time
- Look for detached DOM nodes and growing data structures

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Remove event listeners and timers when no longer needed.
- **Do**: Nullify references to large objects or DOM nodes when done.
- **Don't**: Create global variables unintentionally.
- **Don't**: Keep unnecessary references in closures or caches.

---

## Tips

- Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` for caches and listeners to avoid leaks.
- Profile your app regularly, especially single-page applications (SPAs).
- Use tools like Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Tools, or Node.js heap profilers.

---

## Notes

- Memory leaks are often subtle and hard to detect.
- Even small leaks can add up over time in long-running apps.

---

## Summary

- Memory leaks occur when memory is not released after use.
- Avoid leaks by cleaning up references, listeners, and timers.
- Use dev tools to monitor and profile memory usage in your applications.
