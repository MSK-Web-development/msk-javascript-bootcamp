# 5.8.1 Garbage Collection in JavaScript

Garbage collection (GC) is the process by which JavaScript automatically frees up memory that is no longer in use, helping prevent memory leaks and keeping applications efficient.

---

## How Garbage Collection Works

- JavaScript engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey) use algorithms to detect objects that are no longer reachable and reclaim their memory.
- The most common algorithm is **mark-and-sweep**:
  1. The engine marks all reachable objects starting from roots (global variables, current function stack).
  2. Objects not marked are considered unreachable and are swept (deleted).

---

## Reachability

- An object is **reachable** if it can be accessed in any way (from a variable, property, closure, etc.).
- If there are no references to an object, it becomes unreachable and eligible for GC.

---

## Example

```js
let user = { name: "Alice" };
user = null; // The object { name: 'Alice' } is now unreachable and will be collected.
```

## Types of References

- **Strong references**: Prevent GC (normal variable references).
- **Weak references**: Do not prevent GC (e.g., `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`).

---

## Do's and Don'ts

- **Do**: Let variables go out of scope when no longer needed.
- **Do**: Use `WeakMap`/`WeakSet` for caches or listeners.
- **Don't**: Create unnecessary global variables.
- **Don't**: Hold references to DOM nodes after removal.

---

## Tips

- Modern engines optimize GC, but manual memory management is not possible in JS.
- Use browser dev tools to monitor memory usage and detect leaks.

---

## Notes

- GC is non-deterministic; you cannot force or predict exactly when it will run.
- Memory leaks can still occur if references are unintentionally kept.

---

## Summary

- Garbage collection automatically frees memory for unreachable objects.
- Understanding GC helps you write efficient, leak-free JavaScript code.
- Use weak references and good scoping practices to aid the GC process.
