- Batsmen will automatically rotate strike on odd runs and end of overs. You can also manually rotate the strike with the controls.

- After each wicket, the system will ask for how many runs were made in that ball and which batsmen got out. Select the appropriate answers.

- Similarly after end of each over, the system will ask for the next bowler. Choose the bowler.

- Batting team's innings will automatically end in case of All-Out and End-of-Overs. Then the chase begins.

- After the chasing team's innings ends, the winner will be decided automatically based on cricket rules.
